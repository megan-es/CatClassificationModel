## **What This Project Does**  
This project uses **deep learning** to classify images of **cats and dogs** by breed. It is trained on the **Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**, recognizing **37 different breeds** with high accuracy. The model leverages **MobileNetV2** for efficient and accurate classification.  

### **Key Features**
**Identifies exact cat & dog breeds** (e.g., Siamese, Beagle, Golden Retriever)  
**Uses transfer learning (MobileNetV2)** for fast, efficient training  
**Achieves ~95% training accuracy & ~90% validation accuracy**  
**Removes corrupt images before training** for cleaner data  
**Prevents overfitting** with dropout layers & data augmentation  
**Allows user to test with their own pet‚Äôs photo**

## **Model Performance**
**Final Accuracy:**  
**Training Accuracy:** ~95%  
**Validation Accuracy:** ~90%

## **Limitations**
- This model is trained on 37 breeds, meaning that it will not be inclusive of all breeds of cats or dogs
- Many pets (and most cats) are not purebread- for mixed breeds, this model can only make a low-confidence guess based off of features in common with breeds in the dataset

## **Future Enhancements**
Expand dataset with **more pet breeds**  
Improve robustness with **additional data augmentation**
