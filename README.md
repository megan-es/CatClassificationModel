🐱🐶 Pet Breed Classification Model

Identify your cat or dog’s breed using deep learning

📌 Author: megan-es

📖 Overview

This project uses MobileNetV2 to classify images of cats and dogs by breed. The model is trained on the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset and allows you to test it with your own pet’s photo.

✨ Features

✅ Predicts exact cat & dog breeds
✅ Uses transfer learning (MobileNetV2) for fast training
✅ Removes corrupt images before training
✅ Prevents overfitting with dropout & data augmentation
✅ Test it with your own pet’s image! 🐾

📦 Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

git clone https://github.com/megan-es/CatClassificationModel.git
cd CatClassificationModel
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Download & Extract the Dataset

wget https://thor.robots.ox.ac.uk/pets/images.tar.gz -O images.tar.gz
wget https://thor.robots.ox.ac.uk/pets/annotations.tar.gz -O annotations.tar.gz
mkdir -p dataset/images dataset/annotations
tar -xzf images.tar.gz -C dataset/images
tar -xzf annotations.tar.gz -C dataset/annotations

🧠 Train the Model

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook pet_classification.ipynb

📌 Training includes:
✔️ Preprocessing & filtering the dataset
✔️ Splitting data into training/testing sets
✔️ Training with dropout & augmentation
✔️ Saving the model (pet_breed_classifier.keras)

📸 Predict Your Pet’s Breed

1️⃣ Place your image in test_images/

2️⃣ Run this in the notebook:

image_path = "test_images/your_pet.jpg"  # Replace with your image path
predict_custom_image(image_path)

✅ The model will display the image and predict the breed!

🔬 Example Predictions

🐱 Predicted Cat Breed: Siamese (98.2%)

🐶 Predicted Dog Breed: Golden Retriever (97.5%)

📌 Your Pet’s Prediction:

🚀 Future Improvements

🔹 Support for more pet breeds
🔹 Real-time webcam classification
🔹 Optimize for mobile devices
