## **📖 What This Project Does**  
This project uses **deep learning** to classify images of **cats and dogs** by breed. It is trained on the **Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**, recognizing **37 different breeds** with high accuracy. The model leverages **MobileNetV2** for efficient and accurate classification.  

### **✨ Key Features**
✅ **Identifies exact cat & dog breeds** (e.g., Siamese, Beagle, Golden Retriever)  
✅ **Uses transfer learning (MobileNetV2)** for fast, efficient training  
✅ **Achieves ~95% training accuracy & ~90% validation accuracy**  
✅ **Removes corrupt images before training** for cleaner data  
✅ **Prevents overfitting** with dropout layers & data augmentation  
✅ **Allows user to test with their own pet’s photo**
